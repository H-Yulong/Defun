I would like to thank my project supervisor, Dr Jeremy Yallop, and my Director of Studies, Prof Alan Mycroft, for their countless valuable suggestions, feedback and comments on my project, writing, and academic study in general. I also thank my project co-supervisor David Sheets for sharing his ideas and insights in our weekly meetings.

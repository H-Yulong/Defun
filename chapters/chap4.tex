This chapter presents my work on \textit{abstract defunctionalization}. It consists of the target language, \textit{Defunctionalized Calculus of Constructions (DCC)}, and a type-preserving defunctionalization transformation from the source language (CC) to DCC. 

Section 4.1 introduces abstract defunctionalization and informally explains ideas behind the design of DCC. Section 4.2 presents the formal definition of DCC and Section 4.3 defines the defunctionalization transformation. Section 4.4 proofs that the transformation is type-preserving and correct.

This chapter presents my work on \textit{abstract defunctionalization}. Abstract defunctionalization consists of the target language, \textit{the Defunctionalized Calculus of Constructions (DCC)}, and a type-preserving defunctionalization transformation from the source language (CC) to DCC. 

Section~\ref{sec:4.1} introduces abstract defunctionalization and informally explains the design of DCC and the transformation. Section~\ref{sec:4.2} presents the formal definition of DCC and Section~\ref{sec:4.3} defines the defunctionalization transformation.

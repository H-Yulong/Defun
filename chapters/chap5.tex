In this chapter, I show that the dependently typed defunctionalization is type preserving and correct (Section~\ref{sec:5.1}), and the target language DCC is type-safe and consistent (Section~\ref{sec:5.2}). For simplicity, I use $\target{e}$ to stand for $\bbracket{e}$ and $\target{\fdef_e}$ to stand for $\bbracket{e}_d$ when there is no ambiguity.

In this chapter, I show that abstract defunctionalization is type preserving and correct (Section~\ref{sec:5.1}), and the target language DCC is type-safe and consistent (Section~\ref{sec:5.2}). For simplicity, I use $\target{\Gamma}, \target{e}$ to stand for $\bbracket{\Gamma}, \bbracket{e}$ and $\target{\fdef_\Gamma}, \target{\fdef_e}$ to stand for $\bbracket{\Gamma}_d, \bbracket{e}_d$ when there is no ambiguity.
